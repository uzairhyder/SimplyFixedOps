                        <h2>Meet Your Automotive Industry Resource</h2>
                        <h5>Justin Dumas (JD) , Founder & CEO</h5>
                        <p><span>Our Roots Run Deep in Automotive Passion</span></p>
                        <p>Cars have always been more than just a hobby for us—they’re in our blood. From an early age, I was immersed in the world of classic Mopars, working side by side with my father in the garage of our childhood home. It was there that my love for cars first took shape. My father, a dedicated technician and service professional, spent over three decades in the automotive industry. He ultimately retired in 2015 as the Service Director of a top 5 Ford dealership. His career was one of growth, learning, and unwavering commitment to the world of automobiles.</p>
                        <p>It’s that same spirit of opportunity and progression that inspired me to follow in his footsteps as a second-generation automotive professional. His guidance and knowledge helped me navigate my own career, which spanned 27 rewarding years in automotive dealerships—holding every position from Technician to National Consultant.</p>
                        <p>Along the way, I was lucky enough to lean on my father’s wealth of experience, especially when I stepped into management. He helped me find the best deals on shop supplies, tools, services, and more. Not everyone is fortunate enough to have that kind of support when starting out, and it was this realization that inspired me to create something bigger.</p>
